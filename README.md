# Capstone-Project
Overview of the project:
         If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings?
         Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets.
         Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?
This is the data behind the story Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Fandangoâ€™s openly available on 538's github: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data. 
There are two csv files, one with Fandango Stars and Displayed Ratings, and the other with aggregate data for movie ratings from other sites, like Metacritic,IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes.

  a Metacritic score, a Metacritic User score, and IMDb score, and at least 30 fan reviews on Fandango.
